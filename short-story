Once upon a time, there was a woodcutter, who lived in a little house in a
beautiful, brown wood.
One day, he was merrily chopping some wood, when he saw a little boy skipping
through the woods, whistling happily, followed by a big grey bunny.
Deciding it was really none of his business, the woodcutter went back to chopping
wood, until he heard a scream!
He grabbed his axe and ran towards the noise, where he found that he was too
late: the big grey bunny had already eaten the little boy and her granny.
And the moral of this story is: all it takes for evil to triumph is for good men to do
nothing.
